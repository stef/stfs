stfs - simple tabular file system

    this file system is meant for the embedded flash of cortex-m3
    micro controller. I tried yaffs, but it used too much memory, and
    since the cortex-M3 controller already handles the low level
    stuff, is not really suited for this purpose. stfs uses no heap,
    and is also otherwise as the name hints: simple.

stfs is a log-structured appending file system for embedded flash
devices, that expose the flash mapped as memory.

  - assumes that you have only a few 4KB-128KB erasable blocks - all
    of the same size.

  - stfs provides only directories and files, but no other types like
    pipes, links, etc. also no file metadata like timestamps or access
    permissions.

  - filenames are max 32 bytes long, files max 64KB - both settings
    are configurable, but otherwise untested.

  - always reserves one empty block for vacuuming.

  - default chunksize is 128B with fs metadata included. unlike other
    flash file systems where the block size is usually limited by 512B.

  - totally single threaded

api

   currently the api provides the following posix-like interfaces:

   directory handling functions: mkdir, rmdir, opendir, readdir,

   file handling functions: open, lseek, write, read, close, unlink, truncate

   generic functions: init

how to play with it

    1st of all this is a simulation, a toy. if you want to use it in
    your micro controller you have to adapt a few things. like how you
    write chunks and erase blocks. But you can play with it on your
    computer. Compile everything with the makefile:

    `CFLAGS="-DDEBUG_LEVEL=3" make all`

    where the debug level can be:
       - 0 is quiet,
       - 1 - errors,
       - 2 - info,
       - 3 - debug.

    if you want to fuzz, you probably want to go with level 0, when
    you debug you can play with other levels.

    after compiling, you get `stfs` and `afl`.

`stfs` test binary
   `stfs` demos how to use stfs, executes a few test cases and then
    dumps the whole fs into ./test.img.

afl
    `afl` is a simple script interpreter:

    afl.c - reads stdin to execute script on in-RAM stfs and dump the result into test.img
    commands are
    m <path> - mkdir
    x <path> - rmdir
    o 0|64 <string> - open 64==O_CREAT
    w <fd> <size> - write
    r <fd> <size> - read
    s <fd> <pos> <whence> - seek
    c <fd> - close
    t <size> <path> - truncate
    d <path> - unlink

    <path> is always length prefixed, space-separated, e.g.:
    m 5 /root
        ^ path
      ^ length of path

    ./afl is also used by stfsfuzz.py, if you want to use it with afl,
    you should compile without logging and dumping of the fs image.

    you can find a few sample test cases in `testcases/`

python tools

    there's two python tools: stfsfuzz.py and anaimg.py

    stfsfuzz.py runs `afl` repeatedly each time testing a different
    random command, if the command returns something else than -1, it
    is recorded in ./fuzz.script and keep this command in the test
    case for subsequent commands to be appended. in the background
    `afl` always dumps the latest fs image into `test.img`

    `anaimg.py` loads `test.img` and prints a condensed sequence of
    the chunks, the directory layout with file sizes, and the block
    statistics.

python deps

   `pip install construct sh`

data structure

   chunk_size = 128
   chunks_per_block = 1024

   4 different chunk types are used:

   empty = 0xff (1B) irrelevant(all 0xff) (127B)
   inode (128B)- contain file meta information
     - chunktype (0xAA) (1B)
     - directory | file (1b)
     - size (2B)
     - parent_directory_obj_id (4B)
     - obj_id (4B)
     - name_len (6b)
     - name (32B)
     - data (84B)
   data (7B) - contain data
    - chunktype (0xCC) (1B)
    - seq_id (2B)
    - obj_id (4B)
    - data blob (chunksize-metasize)
   deleted = 0x00 (1B) irrelevant(all 0x00) (127B)

   inode with oid 1 is the root directory and virtual
